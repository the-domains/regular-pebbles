            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Sevenhugs' Smart Remote</h1><p>Looking to simplify the endless number of apps and interfaces used to control smart-home products, French start-up Sevenhugs has introduced the first "contextually aware" universal Smart Remote. In other words, it's the first remote to understand where it is in your home and what it's pointing at, allowing users to simply point and click to control devices instead of switching between apps.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/df1caa77bd36920224edf22d445e863c5b829e80.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Facebook Live video has boomed in a big way with people shooting on their phones, and lots of those users aren't going to shell out for a $399 external camera.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4466be094e86bad9c0e2fe4c5a74c3d32ef5c016.jpg"></article>]]></description>
